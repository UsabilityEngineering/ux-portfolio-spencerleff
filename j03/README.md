As shown in the image above, the backing of the remote has three vertical lines on it, which follows **existing design conventions** that all indicate to place your finger on the lines and slide downward to open the panel.  This opens the back of remote in which batteries can be replaced.  One issue that I've noticed after a few years of use is the huge difference in **efficiency** when the batteries are brand new.  Even when the batteries are only about halway used, actions can take up to a few seconds to register on the actual television, which can get frustrated after only a couple minutes of use.  Overall though, I believe that the Roku TV Remote does its job pretty well, and provides a familiar and comfortable experience for the user.
